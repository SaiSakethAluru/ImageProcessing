Path Planning Algorithms:
Dijkstras Algorithm: 
    Single source shortest path to all nodes in a graph. It is a greedy algorithm.

A-Star Algorithm:
    This is also a greedy algorithm to find shortest path between two nodes.
    In this algorithm, we find the sum of weight of edge + heuristic function for a source to all its neighbours and we move in the direction of least sum. 
    Here, heuristic function is the distance function like manhattan distance = |x1-x2|+|y1-y2|

RRT Algorithm:
    Here we randomly explore the paths that fall within the step size.

Basics of autonomous robotics:

A bot is made up of mainly - Sensors, Microcontrollers, Actuators.
Sensors = camera, etc.
Microcontroller - Arduino.

Arduinos are programmed according to bot requirement. General arduino program consists of a void setup{} that runs only once and a void loop{} that is looped.

E.g. 
void setup
{
pinMode(5,OUTPUT)
}
Void loop
{
digitalWrite(5,HIGH);
delay(1000);
}

The pins A0 - A5 of arduino are for analog input and rest are for digital input.

Pulse Width Modulation: 
If both motors donâ€™t have same rpm, drift occurs. To prevent this, pwm is used. (Given through enable input)

Duty cycle is linearly dependent on rpm of motor. 
L293D: Most commonly used motor driver.
